title: Backstage pass to my theatre experiences!
---
Being in theatre for the past 3 years has shaped me into the person I am now. I would not be where I am now or see the world how I see it now if it weren't being a part of theatre. I see the world differently and I have gained so much confidence being a part of the performing arts.
