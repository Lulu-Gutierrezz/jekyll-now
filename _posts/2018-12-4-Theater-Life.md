## My theatre experiences

I have been in 3 productions at my current high school, La Gringa ( Manolo Cofresi), You’re A Good Man Charlie Brown ( Linus), 
Seussical Jr. (Cat In The Hat). I have attended several high school productions as well as professional performances.
That being said I have attended Thescon two years in a row, Thescon is a place where thespians In high school can attend and 
we participate in a variety of workshops to help improve theatrical performance skills. 

If you would like to checkout workshops they offer every year, check this [out](https://cothespians.com).


## Improved performance 

Being in only 3 productions has taught me to improve my performance such as how to project my voice, how to not only become the 
character but have the character you’re portraying become you. I've learned to always move and talk with a purpose, have the 
audience feel some type of emotion and have the audience understand your character.
